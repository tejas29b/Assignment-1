      Instructions
    </h2>
    <h3>
      STEP 1
    </h3>
    <p>
      Heat the oven 170C/150C fan/gas 3. 
      Put the flour, butter and sugar into a mixing bowl. 
      Use your hands to combine the ingredients until the 
      mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then squeeze until it 
      comes together as a dough.
    </p>
    <h3>
      STEP 2
    </h3>
    <p>
      On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll
      out the dough to Â½ cm thick. Cut the dough into fingers
      and place on a lined baking tray. Use a fork to create 
      imprints, then sprinkle with the remaining caster sugar.
    </p>
    <h3>
      STEP 3
    </h3>
    <p>
      Chill the dough in the fridge for 20 mins, then bake for 
      15-20 mins until golden brown. Remove the shortbread fingers 
      from the oven and leave to cool on the tray for 10 mins.
